# Aether Roguelike

Aether is a roguelike game in which the player is a petty criminal who starts off in jail. The player discovers their ability to manipulate the aether, a mysterious power that no one seems to know anything about. Naturally, the player uses this power to escape prison and live with a bounty on their head, dodging law-enforcement and bounty hunters alike, all while trying to get rich through conning and thievery.

Aether features a distinctive character customization system based on the periodic table of elements. Pick your favorite element, read up on the pros and cons of each group, state of matter, and type, and begin playing!

No player can 'beat' Aether - the game ends when all health point have depleted, and after reaching level 66, health, strength, and endurance start going down.

This game is one big science and Star Wars joke - Will and Grace claim no association with LucasArts or Disney.
