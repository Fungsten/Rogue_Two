// a generally accessible datastore object
// NOTE: this holds the objects the game uses, keyed by object ID (and subgroupd - e.g. all maps are in a MAPS sub-namespace). Relationships between game objects (e.g. UI mode play's current map) are tracked via id rather than fully embedding related objects, which greatly eases persistence headaches (among other things).
