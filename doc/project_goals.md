  * avatar
  * map and navigation
  * help system
  * mobs
  * timing / turn-taking
  * combat
  * mob AI
  * items
  * inventory
* explore and implement various relevant programming patterns and concepts

  * event systems; observers and actors
  * asynchronous actions and callbacks
  * using modern dev tools and techniques
